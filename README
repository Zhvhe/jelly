# How to Reproduce

Requirements:
  * Python 2.7+
  * matplotlib library installed

Please execute paths.py on a system with Python2.7+ installed. The
program will print out a counter until around 680 (for the number of
sender-receiver pairs) and plot a replication of Figure 9 from the
Jellyfish paper. Default parameters are 686 servers, 212 switches,
each switch having 13 ports to connect to other switches and 23 ports
to connect to servers. The output is the plot contained in
figure9.png.
