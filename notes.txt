We should try to find an actual Jellyfish network in production (if one exists).

We should look at the following extensions:

* Randomized link cost instead of all link costs being the same.

* What is a reasonable random switch graph and how many end hosts
  attached per switch

* Generate statistics of path diversity as the network grows from time.
  e.g.
  1 switch 2 servers
  1 switch 3 servers
  1 switch 4 servers
  2 switch 4 servers
  2 switch 5 servers
  ....
  x switches, 600+ servers

  add switch of 24 / 64 ports - from Godfrey's talk

* Check path diversity with different traffic matrix:
  all-to-all
  random permutation
  rack-to-rack
